This is a program to compute convex hull of given points. It takes into
account of colinear points and ignores any middle points on the boundary of a
 convex hull.
 To run it, edit the source.txt file to contain exactly the input, any error
 detected in the file format will be returned. Customized file is also
 supported as long as it's under the same directory of the source.txt file.
 Run the program, according to the prompt, input the file name, and you will
 see the vertices on convex hull in a counter clockwise order. Degeneracy is
 considered and handled.
